- 👋 Hi, I’m Moses, a Front-End Developer passionate about solving real life problems with code. My background is in Electrical Engineering (I know right?), but my love for Tech and building meaningful life-changing projects overtook me (the heart wants what it wants 🥰🥰). I currently work as a Software Engineer with a global company with great company culture and I love it.

- 👀 I’m interested in using data for good by building front-end and that meet the daily needs of users.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Nodejs and Mongo DB for backend development in other to become a full-stake developer💪.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, network with like-minds and ultimately form meaningful friendships.
